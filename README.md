Want to contribute? Follow the steps below to set it up locally.

Step 1: Fork and Clone the repo.<br />
Step 2: run `cd backend yarn install` to install backend dependencies.<br />
step 3: run `cd .. yarn install` to install frontend dependencies.<br />
Step 4: run `yarn dev`. This should launch the website on `localhost:3000`.

We have used proxy so all the requests made to backend from frontend will be served at
`localhost:5000` at which our backend is running.
