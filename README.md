## Getting Started üöÄ 
### Want to contribute? Follow the steps below to set it up locally.

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/MERN-Gurujii-dev.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd MERN-Gurujii-dev

# Install backend dependencies
$ cd backend yarn install

# Install frontend dependencies
$ cd .. yarn install

# Run website
$ yarn dev
```
This should launch the website on `localhost:3000`.

We have used proxy so all the requests made to backend from frontend will be served at
`localhost:5000` at which our backend is running.

### Note üëÄ
- This project uses yarn to install the dependencies. Don't use npm install.
- For security reasons we have made the MongoDb URI secure, by not adding a hardcoded username and password. For development purpose, you can install, MongoDB locally or use the  online version.
